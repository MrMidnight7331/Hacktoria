# The Killer Clown (Easy)
> MrMidnight

-----------------------------------------

### Mission Briefing:

```
Greetings, Special Agent K. We have a very urgent case on our hands. The San Francisco Police Department is working on a true horror case this October. There is an actual killer clown roaming the streets of the greater San Francisco area.

The killer is dressed as a clown and strikes at night, mostly targeting women and younger men. The victims are drugged and bound tightly with a long rope, stretching all the way around the body. After this, the killer attaches an oxygen tank to the victim and puts them inside a coffin sized box. Making it impossible to move, but just enough to breathe slowly.

The victim is then buried alive and a picture is taken of the location, which is then sent to the police. With the amount of oxygen in the tank, victims usually last about 24 hours. Though with the panic setting in, some die within 6 hours. A few others suffered a heart attack from the panic. They are left as a game, for the police to find the location in time, or not. So far there have been several sightings of a clown at night, though only for brief moments. In one of the photoâ€™s, the image of the clown was visible in a car mirror caught on camera.

About 30 minutes ago, the San Francisco Police Department received a new picture from the clown. This time we have reason to believe the victim is Melany Parker, a 23 year old woman from Northwest Berkeley. She was reported missing by her boyfriend, after she didnâ€™t return from her evening jog.

Given the circumstances, we have no time to waste. Your assignment is simple, find the location of the picture below. Before the next victim dies, tied up in a box underground, slowly suffocating while tightly wrapped in ropes.

Special Agent K. The contract is yours, if you choose to accept.

## 1. Download assets
Downlaod the Linkfile

## 2. Finding information

Looking carefully at the briefing text, we can find some intersting informations exposed to us:

>streets of the greater San Francisco area
>a 23 year old woman from Northwest Berkeley
>in a park (as we can see in the image)


## 3. Finding the place

So we know that the place is in the "San Francisco" area and its near "Northwest Berkeley". We will open up google maps and search for [Northwest Berkeley](https://www.google.de/maps/place/Northwest+Berkeley,+Berkeley,+Kalifornien,+USA/@37.8724381,-122.2989265,3613m/data=!3m1!1e3!4m6!3m5!1s0x80857ec5c9d9fa67:0xaf7a4635e5fa6102!8m2!3d37.8741099!4d-122.2965778!16s%2Fg%2F1ywqfdj5n).
Searching in the area, we find the park called [Cadar Rose Park](https://www.google.de/maps/place/Cedar+Rose+Park/@37.872794,-122.2962395,3219m/data=!3m1!1e3!4m15!1m8!3m7!1s0x80857ec5c9d9fa67:0xaf7a4635e5fa6102!2sNorthwest+Berkeley,+Berkeley,+Kalifornien,+USA!3b1!8m2!3d37.8741099!4d-122.2965778!16s%2Fg%2F1ywqfdj5n!3m5!1s0x80857eb881d8ee2d:0x7a11035a6dbf438d!8m2!3d37.876679!4d-122.28817!16s%2Fg%2F1tdhm11l). Now drag the small yello Humanoid from the bottom left to one of the blue points, we will find the exact place where the image was taken, with a little difference tho. Zoom on the path we just saw, we can see that its called:

> Ohlone Greenway

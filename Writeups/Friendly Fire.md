# Friendly Fire
> MrMidnight

-----------------------------------------

### Prologue:
```
The South African soldiers were patrolling a remote region near the border when they heard the sound of an approaching tank. They assumed it was a friendly vehicle, and as they were wearing their military uniforms, they had no reason to suspect otherwise. However, as the tank approached, it began firing shells directly at the soldiers, who scattered for cover.

The group was confused and shocked, believing that they were under friendly fire. They tried to communicate with the tank crew over the radio, but received no response. It was only then that they realized the tank was not one of their own, but rather an enemy tank disguised to look like a South African vehicle.

The soldiers quickly regrouped and made a hasty retreat, running through the rough terrain as the tank continued to fire upon them. They called for backup and waited for an evacuation helicopter to arrive. As they waited, they could hear the sound of the tank drawing closer, and they feared for their lives.

Finally, the helicopter arrived, and the soldiers scrambled aboard, desperate to escape the relentless tank fire. As they lifted off, they could see the tank advancing towards their position, but it was too late for them to do anything about it.

The helicopter crew radioed for air support, and fighter jets were sent to the area to try and locate the enemy tank. But despite their best efforts, they were unable to find it. It had disappeared without a trace, leaving the soldiers to wonder who had been behind the attack and what their motives were.

The soldiers were shaken by the incident, but they knew that they had done the right thing by retreating and seeking help. They vowed to be more vigilant in the future and to never again assume that every vehicle they encountered was friendly.

As for the tank, it remains a mystery. Some believe it was part of a sophisticated enemy operation, while others think it may have been a rogue element acting alone. But one thing is for sure – the soldiers who survived that day will never forget the terrifying sound of the tank’s shells exploding around them.

### Mission Briefing:

```
Greetings, Special Agent K.

Our friends over at the South Africa National Defense Force have reached out for help. Recently, one of their patrols in the north of their country, came under fire from an armored vehicle. At first they thought this to be friendly fire, however no other units were in the area.

They sent a drone to inspect the vehicle and managed to take a photo, before being forced to retreat. Six out of the twenty-four strong platoon were injured, all survived after being evacuated by helicopter.

As they are unfamiliar with the model of the tank, which has since vanished. Therefor they call for our help in identifying the vehicle. That is where you come in, identify the tank so we can track the origins and maybe get further in this investigation.

As always, Special Agent K. The Contract is yours, if you choose to accept.

## 1. Downloading assets

Download the flagfile

## 2. Reverse search the image

Since no downloadable original image is available, I just dragged the image onto my desktop. With that, I used google to reverse search the given Image of the tank. The first result I got was from this website: https://wallpapershome.com/military/vehicles/merkava-mk-4m-tank-german-army-6914.html 

It telling the correct name of the tank which is: 
> ## Merkava Mk.4M

But the contry "Germany" is wrong. I then got a link for this website: https://www.super-hobby.de/products/Merkava-Mk.4M-w-Trophy-APS.html#gallery_start

Now this image reveals the correct contry:
> Israel

## 3. Assemble & Solving

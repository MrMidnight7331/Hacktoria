### Prologue:
```
Mary had always been fascinated by the night sky. She would often sit on her porch in Broomfield Colorado, gazing up at the stars and wondering what kind of life existed beyond our planet. But one night, her curiosity turned into pure shock and wonder when she saw something she never thought she would.

Mary was sitting outside, enjoying the cool evening breeze, when she noticed a bright light in the distance. At first, she assumed it was a plane, but as it got closer, she realized it was something entirely different. The light began to form into a large, disk-shaped object hovering silently over her town.

Mary couldn’t believe her eyes. She rubbed them, thinking it was a trick of the light, but when she opened them again, the object was still there. It was a metallic, silver color, and seemed to be completely still, hovering in the sky as if it was watching over the town.

As she watched, Mary felt a mix of fear and excitement. She knew that what she was seeing was something extraordinary, something that few people had ever witnessed. She pulled out her phone and started recording, capturing the strange object as it hovered above her.

For 10 minutes, Mary watched in awe as the UFO remained motionless in the sky. She tried to make out any details or markings on the craft, but it was too far away, and the bright light made it impossible to see.

Eventually, the object started to move away, rising slowly into the sky until it disappeared completely. Mary sat there for a while, still in shock at what she had witnessed. She couldn’t wait to share her experience with others, but knew that many people would be skeptical.

After waiting a few days, she knew she had to come forward. Mary opened her laptop and began searching for the correct authorities to report a UFO sighting.

### Mission Briefing:

```
Greetings, Special Agent K.

We have an urgent case on our hands for the US government. Our allies at the CIA need us to cover up an alien abduction. On the 2nd of April near Broomfield Colorado, a research craft from the Krohndahkyr took several animals and plants.

Although no humans were taken this time, some residents have made photo’s and possibly video of the incident. It’s imperative that we find the original source where this sighting was reported. The CIA wants a cleanup of all the material. So it’s our job to go and find it for them.

Your task is to find the original URL where the following report and photo were posted:

To find out the original website, we can use a bit of google dorking. We got a lot of different informations from the briefing, but the most importent are the date of post and the location. Its also notable that the URL ends with .html, which we will incloud in our google search. For me, the effective "google" was:
```

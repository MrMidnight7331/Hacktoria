# Far Away Outpost (Hard)
> MrMidnight

-----------------------------------------

### Mission Briefing:

```
Greetings Special Agent K. I hope you’re in the mood for hunting down some poachers. We have a contract from the Kenyan government to track down an animal smuggling and poaching operation.

This group uses various humanitarian organizations as fronts for their poaching operations. Often pretending to be building civilian infrastructure to obscure their activities.

In their latest attempts to stay undetected, the group started to present themselves as construction workers. Traveling to remote villages and outposts to supposedly install water tanks and wells. Unsuspecting locals would let them go about their business, as they used this cover to poach wild animals.

Last week, the Kenyan authorities were able to apprehend one of their members. They were able to extract a few pieces of information from his cellphone. Unfortunately, the young man hung himself that same night. Making further questioning somewhat troublesome.

You’ll find the information we have below. Your mission is simple, find the location of the current poacher outpost.

As always. Special Agent K, the contract is yours, if you choose to accept.

## 1. Download assets

Download first image file
Download second image file
Download flagfile

## 2. Collecting intel

From the briefing text we found out the following:
- Kenyan government
- remote villages and outposts
- Enviorment has few trees and small township

So we narrow down our search to "Africa Kenya". The kenya region is pretty big tho we have to narrow it more down to find our location. 

In a search enginge, I searched for "counties of kenya" and found this site: "https://www.mappr.co/counties/counties-of-kenya/": 
```
1.  Mombasa
2.  Kwale
3.  Kilifi
4.  Tana River
5.  Lamu
6.  Taita Mak Taveta
7.  Garissa
8.  Wajir
9.  Mandera
10.  Marsabit
11.  Isiolo
12.  Meru
13.  Tharaka-Nithi
14.  Embu
15.  Kitui
16.  Machakos
17.  Makueni

Now I looked at every country on the list and tried to match the enviroment. This time I used https://satellites.pro/ as the map. 

## 3. Finding the position

On the map, I set the worldmap to "Africa" and searched for every counties, until I found the place called "Wajir". I entered it in the search function and clicked on the first result shown in the dropdown menu, which matches with the small towns and fewer trees. But it still aint the place we are suppost to find.

By zooming out of the map, and went down a bit, we can find a mountain that looks like the bottom of a shoe or a peanut. There is a X looking road at the bottom of the mountain. When I zoomed on it, I found the house that has a blueish roof just like the image we are given.

## 4. Getting the card

We will assemble the password just like the example password. With a bit off googling and searching on the map, we can find all the infos we need:

country: kenya
county: wajir
road: ogorji-adadijole
nearest-t-split-road: ogorji-gurar

>kenya-wajir-ogorji-adadijole-ogorji-gurar

Now unzip the file and get the card

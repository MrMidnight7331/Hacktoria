# The Sleeper Cell (Medium)
> MrMidnight

-----------------------------------------
### Prologue:
```
Derek sat at his desk, staring at his computer screen in shock. An email had just appeared in his inbox, and it was from the Androktasiai group – the terrorist organization he had secretly been a part of for years.

The message was brief and to the point: “Activation notice. Prepare for bombing mission.”

Derek’s heart raced as he read the words over and over again. He had always known that this moment might come, but he had never truly believed that it would. And now that it had, he wasn’t sure what to do.

On the one hand, Derek had always believed in the cause of the Androktasiai. He had joined the group because he believed that they were fighting for a just and noble cause – to rid the world of the corrupt governments and institutions that oppressed the people.

On the other hand, Derek had always tried to distance himself from the more violent aspects of the group. He had always considered himself a “sleeper cell” member – someone who would lay low and only be activated when the time was right. He had never actually participated in any of the group’s bombings or attacks, and the thought of doing so now terrified him.

But Derek knew that he couldn’t back out now. He had made a commitment to the Androktasiai, and he couldn’t turn his back on them now. So, with a heavy heart, he began to prepare for the mission.

Over the next few days, Derek worked tirelessly to gather all of the materials and equipment that he would need for the bombing. He practiced making the explosives, memorized the target location, and even rehearsed his escape route.

All was ready now, Derek would do whatever is needed to rid this world of the greedy and gluttonous pigs that called themselves people.

### Mission Briefing:

```
Greetings, Special Agent K.

We have an urgent matter on our hands. For several months we’ve been investigating a group called “Androktasiai”. A radical organization who believes in cleansing the planet of what they call gluttony. Believing firmly that humans are a disease that needs to be exterminated, this radical group is well organized and is preparing to strike several targets.

After breaching one of their email accounts, we were able to extract a sent item. The metadata didn’t prove to be of much help, as it was sent to a disposable 10minutemail address.

The contents however are of great interesting. We believe it contains instructions sent from one of the groups’ leaders to a sleeper cell. This sleeper cell will now be activated and preparing to carry out an attack somewhere.

It is your task to figure out what the text means and provide any intelligence about the plans of this organization.

As always, Special Agent K. The Contract is yours, if you choose to accept.

I hope ere this time you have already found out by the words already spoken (if you are not most dull, ignorant, and foolish) the certain matter of the learned Philosophers blessed stone, whereon Alchemy works, while we endeavor to perfect the imperfect, and that with things more then perfect. And for that nature has delivered us the imperfect only with the perfect, it is our part to make the matter (in the former Chapters declared unto us) more then perfect by our artificial labor. And if we know not the manner of working, what is the cause that we do not see how nature (which of long time has perfected metals) does continually work! Do we not see, that in the Mines through the continual heat that is in the mountains thereof, the grossness of water is so decocted and thickened, that in continuance of time it becomes Argent-vive? And that of the fatness of the earth through the same heat and decoction, Sulphur is engendered! And that through the same heat without intermission continued in them, all metals are engendered of them according to their purity and impurity? and that nature does by decoction alone perfect or make all metals, as well perfect as imperfect? 0 extreme madness! what, I pray you, constrains you to seek to perfect the foresaid things by strange melancholical and fantastical regiments! as one says: Woe to you that will overcome nature, and make metals more then perfect by a new regiment, or work sprung from your own senseless brains. God has given to nature a straight way, to wit, continual concoction, and you like fools despise it, or else know it not. ((SoFi-Stadium-33.953417,-118.338863,18)) Again, fire and Azot, are sufficient for you. And in another place, Heat perfects all things. And elsewhere, see, see, see, and be not weary. And in another place, let your fire be gentle, and easy, which being always equal, may continue burning: and let it not increase, for if it does, you shall suffer great loss. And in another place, Know you that in one thing, to wit, the stone, by one way, to wit, decoction, and in one vessel the whole mastery is performed. And in another place, patiently, and continually, and in another place, grind it seven times. And in another place, It is ground with fire, And in another place, this work is very like to the creation of man: for as the Infant in the beginning is nourished with light meats, but the bones being strengthened with stronger: so this mastery also, first it must have an easy fire, whereby we must always work in every essence of decoction. And though we always speak of a gentle fire, yet in truth, we think that in governing the work, the fire must always by little and little be increased and augmented unto the end.

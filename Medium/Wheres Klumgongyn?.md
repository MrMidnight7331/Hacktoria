# Wheres Klumgongyn (Medium)

### Mission Briefing:

```
Greetings Special Agent K. We have quite a strange case on our hands today. Our Lead Counsel [Klumgongyn](https://hacktoria.com/about/), has gone missing in action.

Now don’t be alarmed, I don’t mean this in any dangerous way. Lately the company chat has been used as a dumpster for GIF wars and edgy memes. Klumgongyn was so fed up with this, that he took one of the spaceships and warped to an unknown location.

He says it’s a “surprise vacation” and won’t come back for another two weeks. This is of course unacceptable behavior and we need to find him.

After arrival he sent a picture with the message “see you in two weeks memelords”. We need you to geolocate the image so we can send in a retrieval unit to pick him up.

Whether we’ll actually find him once we’re there is another issue. Shapeshifting alien lizard like creatures are hard to spot. They’ve been posing as politicians for years now and nobody’s really caught on to them either.

Special Agent K, you have 24 hours to locate Klumgongyn. After that we’ll start refusing to reimburse his travel expenses.

## 2. Gathering intel
The briefing didnt really give out much information, it does say that Klumgongyn gone on vacation somewhere. For me vacation associates with island and beaches. We will remember that for later.

On the image we've downloaded, we can notice a straight road, lots of trees a small hut with red roof and the building in the forground, which has purple paint on it. Whats also eyecatching, is the text on the left buildings wall:

```
MY TAXI
S8846646
6882122
```

But also a golden peak of some sort of building in the distance.

## 3. Finding the location

I uploaded the image on google lense, and found this pinterest website:
https://www.pinterest.com/pin/island-street-in-addu-city--415246028121037131/

The page shows streetview of a road on a island called "addu-city". The image there fits our description of long road without curves. So lets search for this island on google maps.

Whole left side of the island called: "Hithadhoo" has an long road reaching from one side of the island to the other side. 

I then dragged the streetview-human on the bottom side of the island and followed the street, till I found the exact position of where the image has been taken:
https://www.google.de/maps/@-0.613228,73.0905,3a,75y,241.53h,89.36t/data=!3m7!1e1!3m5!1sAF1QipP__ayJ1T3j50cDTA96JJJntpEf69hCsORfPHMB!2e10!3e11!7i11000!8i5500

## 4. Getting the card
Just google for the country that this island is in:

>Maldives

and read the roadname from google maps:

>Elhe Didi Magu

Put them together and unlock the zip file

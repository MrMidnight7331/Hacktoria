-----------------------------------------

### Prologue:
```
Hi Agent T, Tiberian Order has a bit of financial difficulties and this is a good opportunity to help Tiberian Order to get out from financial difficulties. Can you find the answer and get the 10000 Bucks? PS the Flag is the FULL name of the person who gave the hair clip to the girl.
```


### Mission Briefing:

```
One day Pretend was surfing the internet and he found a tweet: My friend sent me this photo and asked who gave the hair clip to the girl in the photo and he said he will give me 10000 Bucks if I answer the question correctly. If you know the answer can you PM me? I will give you all 10000 Bucks if you have found the answer. Many thanks ![🙂](https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/svg/1f642.svg) #OSINT #Challenge “Looks interesting, I think forwarding to Agent T is a good idea as I have no clue about this challenge and I have heard that the Tiberian Order is in financial difficulties.” said Pretend.
